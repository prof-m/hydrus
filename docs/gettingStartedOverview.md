# Overview for getting started
This page basically serves as somewhat of a checklist or overview for the getting started part of Hydrus. It's recommended to read at least all of the getting started pages but if you want to head to some specific section directly go ahead and do so.

## Local files
If you already have a significant amount of local files, either downloaded by hand or some other downloader tool head to the [getting started with files](getting_started_files.md)-section to begind importing them.

## Downloading
If you want to download with Hydrus, check out [getting started with downloading](getting_started_downloading.md) and [getting started with subscriptions](getting_started_subscriptions.md). If you want to add the ability to download from sites not already avaiable in Hydrus by default, check out [adding new downloaders](adding_new_downloaders.md) for how and a link to a user-maintained archive of downloaders.

## Tags and ratings
If you've imported and/or downloaded some files and want to get started searching and tagging see [getting started with tags](getting_started_tags.md) and [getting started with ratings](getting_started_ratings.md).

It's also worth having a look at [siblings](advanced_siblings.md) for when you want to consolidate different tags that all mean the same thing, common misspellings, or preferential differences into one tag.  
[Parents](advanced_parents.md) are for when you want a tag to always add another tag. Commonly used for characters since you would usually want to add the series they're from too.

## Duplicates
Have a lot of very similar looking pictures because of one reason or another? Have a look at [duplicates](duplicates.md), Hydrus' duplicates finder and filtering tool.
