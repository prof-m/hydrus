# Version: Compose Specification - https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md

# This is a Docker Compose file for running the Hydrus Client and Server docker images on your own platforms. Only
# the bare bones are included in this `compose.base.yaml` file. To get these images up and running, follow the
# instructions in `template-compose.local.yaml` to make your own `compose.local.yaml` file.

# AFTER creating your own compose.local.yaml file the docker images can be started by navigating to their folder
# in your command-line terminal, and executing the following command:
# `docker compose -f compose.base.yaml -f compose.local.yaml up`
#
# To start up only the Hydrus CLIENT image, use the following command instead:
# `docker compose -f compose.base.yaml -f compose.local.yaml up hydrus-server`
#
# To start up only the Hydrus SERVER image, use the following command instead:
# `docker compose -f compose.base.yaml -f compose.local.yaml up hydrus-client`
